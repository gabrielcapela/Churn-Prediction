# 📡 Churn Prediction 

A machine learning project for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company.  

## 📌 Overview  
Churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a company's services. By anticipating churn, businesses can implement **proactive retention strategies**, minimizing **💰 revenue loss** and improving **📈 long-term profitability**.  

This project aims to classify customers based on individual user data, predicting whether they will cancel their subscription (**0️⃣ = stays, 1️⃣ = leaves**). To achieve the best predictive performance, multiple **🤖 Machine Learning algorithms** were tested and evaluated.  

## 🛠️ Techniques  
This project incorporates key **Machine Learning techniques**, including:  
- **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊  
- **🛠️ Feature Engineering**  
- **⚖️ Data Balancing**  
- **🔄 Pipeline Optimization**  
- **🎯 Cross-Validation**  
- **🛠️ Hyperparameter Tuning**  
- **🤝 Model Ensemble**  

## 🚀 Results & Next Steps  
The final model demonstrated **high recall (0.778), precision (0.717), and accuracy (0.922)** on test data, making it a reliable tool for churn prediction. The next step is to deploy this model as an online application, allowing users to input customer data and receive a **churn probability prediction** in real time.
